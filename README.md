# Toxicology_IBG_UU
Welcome to the github page for the joined course Toxicology from Uppsala University, in here you will have a guide for the third lab: absorption rate as a function of site of injection.
### Introduction
The aim of this lab is to study how the way of administration influences the absorption rate of ethanol. We have data from a group of rats which where divided and study either intravenous (i.v.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. Some rats were given 4-MP (an inhibitor of ADH) and ethanol and others ethanol only.

#### The specific aims of this lab are
1.	For the students to know how to plot the plasma ethanol concentration as a function of time for each of the methods.
2.	For the students to know how to calculate the distribution volume of ethanol in the rats.
3.	For the students to know how to calculate and plot the body burden as a function of time.
4.	For the students to know how to calculate the initial absorption rate of ethanol in rats.
5.	For the students to know how to calculate the elimination rate.
   
You have a quizz with all the questions you need to answer by the end of the lab in Studium!
#### Wet lab theorical part
In order to analyze data we need to know how was the experimental setup.
After injecting and waiting the specific time points for all the individuals the blood samples are prepared. 
Several steps involved diluting the samples, here there is a figure that sumarizes all the different steps:

##### Ethanol solution sample
- The wet lab scientist made pure ethanol samples, to enable measurement of the actual ethanol concentration in the injection solution they dilute the stock ethanol solution 100 times, otherwise they treated the ethanol samples the same way as the samples containing blood.
##### Sample treatment
All samples (including the ethanol sample) are centrifuged at 2 500 rpm in the centrifuge (1.5 ml tubes) for 5 minutes. Transfer 0.9 ml supernatant to new tubes.
##### Determination of ethanol concentration
Depending on way of administration they mixed the samples differently in the cuvettes:

The scientist mixed the sample and the different master mix (not relevant for the data analysis) and measured the absorbency of the samples, at 340 nm in an spectrophotometer. So the raw data we are going to get is absorvance values.

#### Dry lab, data analysis
Now that we have an idea of what was the experimental setup

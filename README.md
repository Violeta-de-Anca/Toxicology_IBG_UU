**Welcome to the github page for the joined course Toxicology from Uppsala University**

In here you will have a guide for the third lab: absorption rate as a function of site of injection.
This lab is divided into two different sessions. In the first one we will introduce R, making sure you have everything installed.
In the second session we will analyze data from a real experiment done in 2019 in rats.
Please note that there is a pre-lab quizz, that you will need to do before the second session. During the second session there will be a quizz lab in which you will answer all the questions that will be appearing in the github page.
If you have any questions please send an email to the coordinator of the course.

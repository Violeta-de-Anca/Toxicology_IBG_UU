# Toxicology_IBG_UU
Welcome to the github page for the joined course Toxicology from Uppsala University, in here you will have a guide for the third lab: absorption rate as a function of site of injection.
### Introduction
The aim of this lab is to study how the way of administration influences the absorption rate of ethanol. We have data from a group of rats which where divided and study either intravenous (i.v.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. Some rats were given ethanol and 4-MP (an inhibitor of ADH) and others ethanol only.
#### The specific aims of this lab are:
1.	For the students to know how to plot the plasma ethanol concentration as a function of time for each of the methods.
2.	For the students to know how to calculate the distribution volume of ethanol in the rats.
3.	For the students to know how to calculate and plot the body burden as a function of time.
4.	For the students to know how to calculate the initial absorption rate of ethanol in rats.
5.	For the students to know how to calculate the elimination rate.
   
You have a quizz with all the questions you need to answer by the end of the lab in Studium!
